            show you the methodology of thinking in this type of<br>
            problems which is very easy but it depends on logic.<br>
            Let's begin with the concept of this problem, like<br>
            many problems you must draw a specific form with stars.<br>
            Here you must know that it's very difficult to solve this<br>
            problem without a small hint which is the division of the<br>
            pyramid (the specific form in this problem) to two pieces.<br>
            "Stars" and "fake points", why fake points? Because it's easier<br>
            to see the free spaces replaced by points in the beginning then<br>
            delete them and draw our pyramid. How it's done? First, we<br>
            must draw line by line using iteration, a for loop for the<br>
            first group of points then another for stars, after that we<br>
            must separate the two semi-pyramids with two points for<br>
            each line, then we continue iterating through the second<br>
            semi-pyramid. Here we remove these points and the difficult<br>
            part is done. But how the iteration is working? Actually, the<br>
            iteration depends on the parameter of the function, how is<br>
            that? Usually, we can't make a global base for iterating, but<br>
            you must see the numbers of stars and points how it's changing<br>
            and make a numerical sequence then use it, thus we solved the<br>
            big part of the problem and the smallest left, which depends on<br>
            the parameter (no - numbers, the parameter is between 5 and 9).</p></div>
