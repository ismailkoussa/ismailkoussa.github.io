               <h2><span id="title">This is my 15Puzzle game which I made with Javafx</span><br>
                 <br><div id="text"> At the beginning of the game you see a big square <br>
                  that contains 16 mini_squares, each square contains<br>
                  a different number, except the number 16 because it's<br>
                  hidden. What about playing? don't worry it's very simple,<br>
                  each square next to that of number 16 had the right to <br>
                  swap places with it, you can swap them by clicking on the<br>
                  square which you want him to take its place. But what is <br>
                  the main idea of the game? you must sort these numbers<br>
                  from 1 to 16 by swapping and swapping till you reach the end.</div>
